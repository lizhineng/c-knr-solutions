# Solution to The C Programming Language 2nd, KnR

How time flies! The book has been sitting on my bookshelf for almost a decade,
and I still haven’t finished it. I want to start it over and am determined to
complete it this time.

The book is my exercise solutions to The C Programming Language, Second
Edition, by Kernighan and Ritchie, in its Chinese version.

Although I’m not a professional C programmer, my experience with low-level
programming languages can deepen my understanding of how PHP works. This, in
turn, will help me write better PHP code, which I work with every day.
